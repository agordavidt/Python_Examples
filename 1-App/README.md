# Python Tkinter GUI App
Converts the height of a  person from one unit to another,
the tkinter library is used to create the GUI, and the float
function to convert the user's input from a string to a number
that can be used in the conversion calculations.

## How it Works
The app consists of a text entry box where the user can input their height,
a set of radio buttons to select the unit of measurement for their height, 
and a button to initiate the conversion.

When the button is clicked, the app converts the height to the selected unit 
of measurement and displays the result in a label below the button.
